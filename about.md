Hello! I am Sunny Mishra, the creator of this blog. Professionally I am a senior developer with a decade of experience working on Backend architecture solutions. An an hobbyist I would like to call myself a Storyteller. I am also trying to become a YouTuber, but that's a story for another day.

Ok, why have I created this blog? That's because of 2 reasons. 1. I wanted a channel for my creative outbursts, specially in terms of writing. 2. As I get asked hundreds of questions on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunny-mishra) relating to Software engineering, I reckoned it would be good if I could document my journey somewhere so that it could benefit others aspiring to be a software engineer.

Most of my blog posts here would be in terms of stories. Because who doesn't like a good story :)
